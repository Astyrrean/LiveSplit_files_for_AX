# LiveSplit Files / Auto Splitter for Thargoid Interceptors

These files enable you to time your Thargoid interceptor fights with LiveSplit.

Don’t know what “Thargoid interceptors” are? You’re probably not playing Elite
Dangerous then.

Don’t know what [“LiveSplit”](https://livesplit.org) is? It allows you to time
speedruns of your favourite games!

## Setup

1. Download LiveSplit from https://livesplit.org/downloads/.
2. Clone this repository or download (green button in the top right of the repo
   view → “Download ZIP”) and extract it to a folder of your choosing.
3. Create a new LiveSplit layout or load one of the provided ones.
4. In layout settings, “Scriptable Auto Splitter” tab, set 
   `Thargoid_Interceptor.asl`.
5. Enable netlogs in-game in “Options” → “Networking”. You have to do this from
   the main menu, not logged into a mode.

## Recording a Run

1. Load the correct layout. You can use Hydra for everything, that will just
   lead to some wasted space in the “Splits” section.
2. Load the correct splits for the interceptor you are about to fight.
3. Happy hunting!

Please be aware that your attempts and associated times will be saved to the
selected splits file. If there is ever going to be an update to those, you will
have to manually copy your data over or you are going to lose it.
